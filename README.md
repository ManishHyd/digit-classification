Dummy commit to make the feature branch ahead of main branch

sytem requirements:
OS:
h/w -- maybe skipped

how to setup:
- install conda
- conda create -n digit python=3.9
- conda activate digit
- pip instal -r requirements.txt

how to run:
- python exp.py

Meaning of failuers:
- poor performance metrics
- coding runtime/compile error

Places of randomness:
1. creating the split
    - freezing the data

1.5 -- data order (learning is iterative)

2. model
    - weight initialization


feature:
- vary model hyper parameters
